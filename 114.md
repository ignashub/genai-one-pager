# Sprint 1 Part 4: Build an Interview Practice App

**Description:**

In this project, you will need to build an Interview Practice app with prompt engineering, an OpenAI API, and a user interface.

Later, you could use this for your own needs to practice for interviews.

**Topics:**



* Interview Prep
* ChatGPT
* Prompt Engineering
* Web applications

**Prerequisites:**



* Python or JavaScript knowledge
* Knowledge of ChatGPT and OpenAI API
* Basic knowledge of building a front-end application

**Estimated time to complete:** 5 hours


## Task Description

A huge round of applause comes to you for reaching this step. You have started with sprint 1 on prompt-engineering. You are just at the start of the AI engineering course, but you know the very basics, so let’s get that into action.

This project will be a good starter. You will build your own Interview Preparation app. I would imagine that you have participated in several interviews at some point. You have been asked questions. You were given exercises or some personality tests to complete.

Imagine if there is a way to practice for all of that in an efficient and interesting way.

Fortunately, ChatGPT comes to help. With it, you can do pretty much everything, including preparing for your next dream position.

Your task will be to implement a single-page website using **VS Code** (or Cursor) editor, and either a Python library called Streamlit or a JavaScript framework called Next.js.  \
 \
You would need to call OpenAI, write a system prompt as the instructions for ChatGPT, and your own prompt with the interview prep instructions.

You will have a lot of freedom in the things you want to practice for your interview. We don’t want you to put it in the box. Interview Questions? Specific programming language questions? Asking questions at the end of the interview? Analyzing the job description to come up with the interview preparation strategy? Experiment!

**If you feel confident and have experience in software engineering, feel free to over-engineer the app by adding different things from the Optional Tasks, plus coming up with your own things. You can try making it as a portfolio project!**

Remember, you have all of your tools at your disposal if, for some reason, you get stuck or need inspiration: ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or your friend!


## Task Requirements

**The exact task requirements are as follows:**



1. Research the exact nature of interview preparation you want to do. This is intended as we want you to explore and get creative!
2. Figure out how you are going to build the front-end, either using [specific Streamlit components](https://streamlit.io/components?category=text), or HTML/CSS in Next.js.
3. Create an OpenAI API Key for this project.
4. Write at least 5 system prompts with different techniques (few-shot learning, Chain-of-Thought, Zero-Shot Prompting, etc) and check which one works best for you.
5. Tuning at least one OpenAI setting (temperature, Top-p, frequency, etc)
6. Adding at least one security guard to your app to prevent misuse.

## Optional Tasks

After the main functionality is implemented and your code works correctly, and you feel that you want to upgrade your project, choose one or more improvements from this list.



1. Ask ChatGPT to critique your solution from the usability, security, and prompt-engineering sides. 

2. Improving ChatGPT prompt for your personal domain in which you would like to interview prep: IT, finance, HR, communication, etc. 

3. Adding a separate text field or another field to include the job description (the position) you are applying for and getting interview preparation for that particular position. 

4. Implementing more security constraints, like user input validation and system prompt validation. What about using ChatGPT to validate these things? 

5. Adding all of the OpenAI settings (models, temperature, frequency, etc.) for the user to tune as sliders/fields. 

6. Deploying your app to the Internet. 

7. (hard) Using Streamlit (Python) or React (JS) components, implementing a full-fledged chatbot application instead of a one-time call to the OpenAI API. 

8. Calculating and providing output to the user on the price of the prompt. 

9. **BONUS: Read [OpenAI API ](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)documentation, think of your own improvement, and implement it.**


## Evaluation Criteria



* The learner understands the basic principles of how the program works.
* The learner knows how to build a single-page front-end website using their knowledge and/or external resources (internet, Chat-GPT, etc.)
* The learner’s project works as intended; you can prepare for an interview by asking for help from the ChatGPT.
* The learner understands the potential problems with the application. They are able to detect the potential improvements.
* The learner understands differences between user, system, and assistant roles.
* The learner understands basic prompt engineering techniques.
* For the maximum mark, **at least two optional tasks** are completed.

## How to get started with Streamlit

It is very likely that you are seeing and hearing about Streamlit for the first time. No worries!

It's a fantastic framework for creating interactive web apps using Python, particularly for **data visualization**, **machine learning demos**, and **quick prototyping**.

You don’t need to know much about front-end things, like HTML, CSS, JS, React, or others, to build apps! Streamlit will do the basics of front-end for you by just writing Python code.

**Learning Streamlit:**



* You can get started by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0D4Pa22iG0&ab_channel=pixegami). 
* After that, check out their [page](https://streamlit.io/). 
* Check their documentation on[ page elements](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference). 
* A good starting point could be their [“Get Started” section](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started).
* Lastly, GeeksForGeeks also offers a good tutorial on [Streamlit](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-beginners-guide-to-streamlit/).
* [YouTube short.](https://youtube.com/shorts/iPj6QKMd8qA?si=d0i19vdfr3x4jAn0)
* Tutorial on using Streamlit in [VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2siBrMsqF44&ab_channel=TechWithTim).

## Approach to solving the task



* Take a look at the “How to Get Started” section (added below) to get some ideas on how to get started with building a web page.
* 1-5 hours of attempting to solve the task using your own knowledge + ChatGPT. It is encouraged to use ChatGPT both for:
    * Understanding this task better
    * Writing the code
    * Improving the code.
    * Understanding the code.
* If you feel that some knowledge is missing, please revisit the parts in Sprint 1 OR check out additional resources.
* If during the first 1-2 hours you see you are making no progress and that the task seems much too hard for you, we recommend 10 more hours working on the problem with help from peers and JTLs. 
* Out of these 10 hours, you are expected to spend about half of them working with someone else—whether it is peer study buddies, peers who have completed the exercise and want to help you, or JTLs in open sessions.
* If you still can’t solve it, check the suggested solution and spend as much time as needed (also based on what you have available until the next deadline) to understand it.
